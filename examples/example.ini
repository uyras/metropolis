; it contains main section and additional calculatable parameters
; identified by the name of section and ID of parameter divided by : symbol

; Next parameters are supported: correlation, correlationpoint, magnetisation, magnetisationlength


; several option from the main section may be overrided from command line

field = 0.7|0.8 ; add external field
boundaries = open ; open or periodic boundary conditions
; For periodic you have to set size along x and y
size = 100|200 ; set rectangle of the lattice to translate it over the space
restart = 1 ; restart the program if found lower energy. Default is 1.
restartThreshold = 1e-6 ; minimal difference between the initial and lower energy, in relative to initial energy units. Default is 1e-6.
saveGS = system_gs.mfsys ; if defined, the resulting GS will be saved to this file
binder = 1 ; f set, calculate fourth-order cumulants for all parameters (energy, magnetisation, etc.).

; get the correlations between spins
[correlation:AB] ; parameter type: correlation, id: AB
method = xor,scalar,energy ; this will create three parameters with different methods

spins = 1,2,3,4,5 ; limit corellations only by this spins and their neighbours within minrange and maxrange

[magnetisation:mAll]  ; get the magnetisation along selected axis
axis = 1|0, 0|1 ; this will create two parameters with different basic axis

[magnetisation:mxy]
axis = 1|1
spins = 0,30,1,31 ; this will measure diagonal magnetisation only for spins 0,1,30,31
module = 1 ; calculates the average over modules of magnetisation instead of simple magnetisation. Default is false

[magnetisationlength:ml] ; get the temperature average over the length of the total magnetisation vector
spins = 0,30,1,31 ; If you dont set spins, it will calculate all spins
